# Genetic-Algorithm-Number-Array
This program is a simple genetic algorithm built from the ground up. It is given an array, that can be any size, 
of random numbers and is asked to create an array with the same numbers in the correct order without "copy and pasting". 
Seems easy but imagine given a list of 10,000 random numbers and they are all 99.
